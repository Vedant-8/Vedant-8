## About Me

I’m a software engineer focused on building **efficient, scalable, and reliable systems**, with a strong interest in **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**. I enjoy working across backend systems, APIs, and data-driven models with an emphasis on performance and clean architecture.

Outside of engineering, I follow **Formula 1** for its engineering depth, strategy, and execution under pressure — values that subtly shape how I approach problem-solving.
